This is a snake game for the GBA that I created as a personal project.

Just run the .gba file in your favorite GBA emulator

For you code nerds, or if there isn't a .gba file, open the folder you downloaded the files to in a terminal, and type the command "make"(without the ""). That should make a .gba file, which you can run
